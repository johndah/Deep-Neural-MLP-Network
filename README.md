# Deep-Neural-MLP-Network
Multi Layer Perceptron implemented to predict labels of the Cifar data set of handwritten digits. 
It is way more stable than the shallow network uploaded and is robust for higher learning rates and way deeper networks. 
It applies a ReLu activation function, batch normalization and moving averages on top of attributes of the shallow network.
